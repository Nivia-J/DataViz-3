        <p> Amul topicals have touched the hearts of Indians for more than 40 years now. 
            Liked by all ages, these witty and adorable topicals have been a reflection 
            of the society and it's mood. Being highly contexual and relevant
            The idea is to decode the the Amul topicals which have been among 
            the longest running advertisement campaignes in the world.
