        <h2> VITAMIN DEFICIENCY IN RUSSIA  </h2>

        <h3> Purpose of the viz</h3> <hr> <br>
        <p>
            <b> Objective - </b>The visualization attempts to present the prevelant 
            vitamin and mineral defficiencies in different parts of Russia.
            <br> <br> 
            <b> Goal - </b> The goal is to educate the audience about the prevelant
            deficiencies in their region and what food and dietary habits can help bridge the 
            gap.
            <br> <br>
            <b>Audience - </b> The audience is mostly the residents of Russia and all the general
            public who would be interested in exploring the vitamin deificiency scenario in the country
            The information is presented in a very easy to understand format which reduces the cognitive 
            load of the readers and help them understand the situation. 
            <br> <br>
            The visualization is able to hold the viewers attention and present the idea very effectively.
            The research is conducted by one of Russia's reputed research organisation and the article very
            honestly states the inavailability of data wherever they are unable to provide the data. 
            The reader is also able to understand what kind of data is difficult to collect.
        </p> <br><br>

        <h3> Visualization Design</h3> <hr> <br>
        <P>
            <b> Visual Encoding Patterns - </b> The visualization uses the visual language of tetris blocks
            to represent various vitamins, it is a metaphor to the vitamins being the building blocks of our body. 

            <br> <br> <img src="critique/tetris.jpg" class="inside"> <br> <br>
            
            The visualisation uses colour coding to denote the level of deficiency in the population. 
            The same colour encoding has been used throught the article whic helps readers to align to the 
            information and there is a sense of continuity. 

            <br> <br> <img src="critique/deficiency.jpg" class="inside"> <br> <br>

            Simple visualizations have been used to explain the level of deficiency 
            There is a level of interactivity to the viz, the bars are annotated when 
            hovered over them adding to the ease of readability. 
            <br> <br>
            The author starts from the bigger picture and then letting the reader explore 
            more details as he reads on without getting into a lot of technicalities. 
        </P> <br><br>

        <h3> Interaction & Narrative Design</h3> <hr> <br>
        <p>
            <b> Narrative -</b> <br>
            The narrative stype used in the project is the martini style.
            
            <br> <br> <img src="critique/martini.jpeg" class="inside"> <br> <br>

            The narrative style is - Explainatory <br><br> The author starts with the context, goes more into details of each of the 
            deficiencies, their causes and vitamin rich foods, further letting the readers
            explore the conditions of their own reagion, if a reader does not choose a region, 
            the narrative takes an example of Moscow and presents data specific to Moscow. Later
            the author leaves the stage open in the form of an exploratory map hovering over which
            gives the situation of that particular region.
            <br><br>

            <b> Interactivity -</b> <br>
            In the first part of the visualization, interactivity is only used to annotate the charsts 
            on hovering which assists the reader to read the values. In second exploratory part of the 
            visualization, the reader is asked to choose the region they want to explore using a drop down 
            menu - 

            <br> <br> <b> Step 1 </b> <br> <img src="critique/step-1.jpg" class="inside"> <br> <br>

            <b class="whitebg"> Suggestion - </b> <br><br>

            It will be easier for the reader to also have an option 
            to choose the region on a map as geographically location a region is much more intuitive than searching 
            for it in a drop down menu, having both the options will be able to help a larger audience.
            <br> <br>
            The next view gives the reader an overview of the vitamin city of the status, coloured tetris blocks highling 
            the level of deficiency of each vitamin in that state. 

            <br> <br> <b> View 1 </b> <br> <img src="critique/step-2.jpg" class="inside"> <br> <br>

            After this the reader is given a more detailed version of the deficiency status to understand the picture in a 
            better way.On hovering the reader can see the values in absolute terms based on the requirement and the average 
            consumption of a particular vitamin in that region. 
            
            <br> <br> <b> View 2 </b> <br> <img src="critique/step-3.jpg" class="inside"> <br> <br>
            
            After this the author is given more information regarding the 
            causes of the deficiency and how it can be eliminated. The author also makes use of icons for faster communication. 

            <br> <br> <b> View 3 </b> <br> <img src="critique/step-4.jpg" class="inside"> <br> <br>

            The author further goes on to talk about how these deficiencies found in the region affect the 
            human body. 

            <br> <br> <b> View 4 </b> <br> <img src="critique/step-5.jpg" class="inside"> <br> <br>

            This view lets the reader to go through the cards if interested or the reader 
            can decide to skip this part and move on furher. The author then suggests the best foods to eat 
            for that region which help eliminate the prevelant deficiency. 

            <br> <br> <b> View 5 </b> <br> <img src="critique/step-6.jpg" class="inside"> <br> <br>

            It also mentions the level of which the daily requirement is met with every 100 grams 
            of that particular food. With this the author leaves the reader to explore beyond the 
            selected region and provides the opportunity to compare different regions.
