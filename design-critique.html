        <h2> VITAMIN DEFICIENCY IN RUSSIA  </h2>

        <h3> Purpose of the viz</h3> <hr> <br>
        <p>
            <b> Objective - </b>The visualization attempts to present the prevelant 
            vitamin and mineral defficiencies in different parts of Russia.
            <br> <br> 
            <b> Goal - </b> The goal is to educate the audience about the prevelant
            deficiencies in their region and what food and dietary habits can help bridge the 
            gap.
            <br> <br>
            <b>Audience - </b> The audience is mostly the residents of Russia and all the general
            public who would be interested in exploring the vitamin deificiency scenario in the country
            The information is presented in a very easy to understand format which reduces the cognitive 
            load of the readers and help them understand the situation. 
            <br> <br>
            The visualization is able to hold the viewers attention and present the idea very effectively.
            The research is conducted by one of Russia's reputed research organisation and the article very
            honestly states the inavailability of data wherever they are unable to provide the data. 
            The reader is also able to understand what kind of data is difficult to collect.
        </p> <br><br>

        <h3> Visualization Design</h3> <hr> <br>
        <P>
            <b> Visual Encoding Patterns - </b> The visualization uses the visual language of tetris blocks
            to represent various vitamins, it is a metaphor to the vitamins being the building blocks of our body. 

            <br> <br> <img src="critique/tetris.jpg" class="inside"> <br> <br>
            
            The visualisation uses colour coding to denote the level of deficiency in the population. 
            The same colour encoding has been used throught the article whic helps readers to align to the 
            information and there is a sense of continuity.
